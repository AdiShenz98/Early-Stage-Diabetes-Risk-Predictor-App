## ![image](images/Description.png) Description

A simple web application where individuals can estimate their risk of developing diabetes at an early stage based on certain symtom parameters.

## ![image](images/motivation.png) Motivation
**Diabetes** represents a spectrum of metabolic disorders, which has become a major health challenge worldwide. The unprecedented economic development and rapid urbanization in Asian countries, particularly in India has led to a shift in health problems from communicable to non-communicable diseases. Of all the non-communicable diseases, diabetes leads the list.

**India** has a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus and the numbers are increasing at an alarming rate. In India alone, diabetes is expected to increase from **40.6 million** in _2006_ to **79.4 million** by _2030_. Studies have shown that the prevalence of diabetes in **urban Indian adults** is about **12.1%**, the onset of which is about a decade earlier than their western counterparts and the prevalence of **Type 2** diabetes is **4â€“6** times higher in urban than in rural areas. The risk factors peculiar for developing diabetes among Indians include high familial aggregation, central obesity, insulin resistance and life style changes due to urbanization

> **The rising prevalence of diabetes and its complications will place a significant financial burden on our country's health-care system. Timely effective interventions/measures and screening tests for complications at the time of diagnosis becomes imperative not only for early detection, but also to prevent progression to end stage disease.**
